# Mr Lee's Classroom
A flutter app for my students to access lesson materials through their mobile devices.

Students of mine are issued a unique Login ID at the beginning of the semester. The unique ID allows them to log into the app and view crucial information such as Course Announcements, Course Materials, and review any Quizzes they have taken.
